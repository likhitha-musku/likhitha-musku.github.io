### Topology Identification of VAV (Variable Air Volume) units
<div style="text-align: justify">The goal is to identify the layout of a given building to check which units are adjacent/nearby each other and determine the temperature correlation between them if they are situated nearby. The data is from the [Systems Engineering Building (SEB)](https://bbd.labworks.org/), a medium size commercial building at PNNL. It contains multiple attributes related to energy consumption, with minute-level data, starting from 11/30/2018 5:09:00 PM upto 5/6/2020  4:59:00 PM, thus a total of 533,031 records. This dataset contains the information related to multiple AHU (Air Handling Unit) and their VAV units.
